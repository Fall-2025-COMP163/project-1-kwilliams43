Game Concept
This project is a **text-based RPG Character Creator** where players can build and manage a fantasy-style hero.  
The world is a classic role-playing universe filled with warriors, mages, rogues, and clerics — each with their own strengths and magical abilities.  

When the player creates a character, they immediately get to see their stats, save their progress to a file, and even level up.  
The idea is to simulate the feeling of building your first RPG hero — one that could later be used in a larger adventure game.

Design Choices
The stat formulas were designed to reflect traditional RPG class strengths while keeping the math simple and balanced for beginners:

| Class | Stat Focus | Formula Highlights |
|:------|:------------|:------------------|
| **Warrior** | Physical power and defense | High Strength (+5 per level), High Health (+10 per level) |
| **Mage** | Magic and intellect | High Magic (+5 per level), Lower Health |
| **Rogue** | Agility and speed | Moderate Strength (+4 per level), Balanced Magic (+4 per level) |
| **Cleric** | Healing and support | Balanced Strength (+3 per level), Magic (+3 per level) |

Each stat grows with level, showing clear progression.  
I chose these formulas because they are intuitive, easy to test, and highlight class differences without making the code overly complex.

Bonus Creative Features
While the main goal was functionality, I added a few creative touches:
- **Automatic Save System** – Every character is saved to a text file named after the player’s character.  
- **Formatted Character Sheet** – Clean and readable stat display for easy viewing.

AI Usage
I used AI assistance (ChatGPT) during development to:
- Fix **syntax** and **indentation** errors in early drafts.  
- Debug issues in **file I/O**, ensuring characters saved and loaded correctly.  
- Improve code **readability** and add **docstrings** for clarity.  
All logic and formulas were still designed and implemented by me.
