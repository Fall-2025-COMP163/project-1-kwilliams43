This project is a Character Creator program written in Python. It allows users to create a custom RPG-style character, save and load character data to a text file, and simulate leveling up.
The goal of this project is to practice functions, dictionaries, file I/O, and program structure in Python.

The program demonstrates:

Function design and return values
Dictionary usage for storing character stats
Reading and writing data to text files
Conditional logic and calculations
Input/output formatting and user interaction



Features


Create a Character – Enter a name and select a class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Cleric).
Auto-Generate Stats – The program calculates initial stats (strength, magic, health, gold) based on the chosen class.
Save Character – Save your character’s details to a text file in a clear, formatted layout.
Load Character – Reload your character’s stats from a file to continue progress.
Display Character Sheet – Print all stats in an easy-to-read format.
Level Up System – Increase your level and recalculate stats automatically.

How It Works


calculate_stats(character_class, level)
Determines the base stats for the chosen class.
Returns a tuple of (strength, magic, health).
Each class has unique stat growth rates:
Warrior: High strength and health, low magic.
Mage: High magic, low strength, moderate health.
Rogue: Balanced stats, agile and quick.
Cleric: Strong in magic and health.



create_character(name, character_class)

Creates a dictionary representing the character.
Initializes:
level = 1
gold = 100
Calls calculate_stats() to generate base attributes.




save_character(character, filename)

Saves all character information to a text file in a human-readable format.
Returns True if the file saves successfully, otherwise False.



load_character(filename)


Reads data from a previously saved text file.
Reconstructs and returns a character dictionary.
Returns None if the file is not found.


display_character(character)

Prints a formatted character sheet to the console



level_up(character)

Increases the character’s level by 1.
Recalculates stats using calculate_stats().
Prints a confirmation message


How to Run the Program
